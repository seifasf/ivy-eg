# Fix Logo Not Loading on Deployed Website

## The Issue
Your logo file exists locally at `/public/IMGs/IVY-03.png` but it's not showing on the deployed website because it hasn't been committed and pushed to your repository.

## Quick Fix (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Add the Logo to Git
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Documents/GitHub/ivy-eg
git add public/IMGs/IVY-03.png
```

### Step 2: Commit the Logo
```bash
git commit -m "Add IVY logo for deployment"
```

### Step 3: Push to Deploy
```bash
git push
```

Your deployment platform (Netlify/Vercel) will automatically rebuild and the logo will appear!

## Alternative: Manual Upload (If using Netlify)

If you're using Netlify and want to fix it immediately:

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site
3. Go to "Deploys" tab
4. Click "Deploy manually"
5. Drag and drop your entire project folder
6. Done!

## Verify Logo is Ready

Your logo is already in the correct location:
- ✅ File exists: `/public/IMGs/IVY-03.png`
- ✅ Size: 126 KB
- ✅ Code is already updated to use this path

All pages reference the logo correctly:
- ✅ Header (desktop and mobile)
- ✅ Home page hero
- ✅ Footer

Once you push the changes, the logo will appear everywhere!

## What Happens After Push?

1. Git will track the logo file
2. Your deployment platform will automatically detect the push
3. It will rebuild your site (takes 1-2 minutes)
4. Logo will appear on all pages
5. ✅ Done!

## Still Not Working?

If the logo doesn't appear after pushing, check:

1. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
   - Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

2. **Check Deployment Logs:**
   - Look for any errors in your Netlify/Vercel dashboard
   - Make sure the build completed successfully

3. **Verify File Path:**
   - The file MUST be at: `public/IMGs/IVY-03.png`
   - Case-sensitive! `IMGs` not `imgs` or `images`

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues, let me know:
- Which deployment platform are you using? (Netlify/Vercel/Other)
- Can you see the logo when running locally (`npm run dev`)?
- Any error messages in the browser console (F12)?
