## ⚠️ To-Do Before Launch

### 1. Logo File
**Action Required:** Place your white logo file at:
```
/public/IMGs/IVY-03.png
```
- The logo should be PNG with transparent background
- Should be white color (CSS applies filter)
- Recommended size: 200px+ width

### 2. EmailJS Setup (For Contact Form)
**Action Required:** Configure EmailJS credentials in:
```
/src/services/emailService.js
```

Steps:
1. Create free account at https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Add Gmail service with `ivyforhelp@gmail.com`
3. Create email template (see instructions in file)
4. Replace these values:
   - `YOUR_SERVICE_ID`
   - `YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY`

**Note:** The contact form will work without this, but emails won't be sent until configured.

### 3. Order Confirmation Emails (For Checkout)
The checkout page uses the same EmailJS service. Once you configure EmailJS for the contact form, the order confirmation emails will also work.

Current behavior: Orders are submitted but emails are not sent (EmailJS not configured yet).

### 4. Backend Integration (Future)
When you're ready to add products from a backend:
- Products are currently showing "Coming Soon"
- API integration code is ready in `Products.jsx` (currently disabled)
- See the earlier `API_INTEGRATION.md` for details
