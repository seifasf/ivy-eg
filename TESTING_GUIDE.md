## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Can't login
**Fix:**
- Verify admin account created (Step 1)
- Check email/password match exactly
- Look at browser console (F12) for error messages
- Backend must be running on port 5001

### Issue: Dashboard stats are all 0
**Solution:** This is normal! Stats will populate as you add:
- Products
- Orders
- Promo codes

### Issue: Shipping fees not showing
**Fix:**
- Run initialize endpoint (Step 2)
- Check backend response
- Refresh admin page

### Issue: "CORS error" in browser console
**Fix:**
- Backend CORS is configured for localhost:3000 and localhost:5174
- Should work automatically
- If not, check backend `index.js` CORS settings

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized"
**Fix:**
- Token expired (valid for 7 days)
- Logout and login again
- Check `localStorage.adminToken` in browser DevTools

### Issue: Images not uploading
**Solution:**
- Current implementation uses image URLs
- For file upload, need to implement FormData in frontend
- Can add this feature next
